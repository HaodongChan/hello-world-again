# hello-world-again

Hi everybody,
 
    chd here, I like awesome things as everybody else.
    But I'm usually worrying about my schoolwork, which is because of my easy inattention or distraction.
    In brief, I'm now worrying about the report to be handed tomorrow but still writing README.md anxiously as a way of avoidance.
